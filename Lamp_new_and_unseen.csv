0,81407905,I love the lamp but I do not like the flickering on the high setting for my daughter. I think that’s what makes me wanting to return it!,3,True
1,81407905,This lamp works when it feels like it. It flashes and blinks and sometimes just doesnt work at all!!!,1,False
2,81407905,"This lamp does not work. Cute, but not functional",1,False
3,81407905,My girls love them. It looks fabulous.,5,True
4,81407905,"I bought this for my toddler son’s room because it is a adorable design! HOWEVER, there is only one way to turn it on, and that’s using the dimming switch that you have to dial with your finger. If you put a regular bulb in it, the lowest and first setting of the dial makes the bulb flash like a strobe light. So that means you have to purchase an actual dimming light bulb. I think the dim option is a neat idea, if you want a low amount of light (middle of the night in a nursery, etc.), but I wish it had an alternative/traditional switch to turn it on. Because you need to use the dial on the cord as the power switch, that means the cord has to hang down next to the lamp, making it a really big hazard for a toddler to pull down on him/herself. I will be returning it.",1,False
5,81407905,The lamp was cute. But it was like they took it off the shelf and threw it in a target shipping box. I have never bought a lamp that did not come in its own box from the manufacturer. Usually a shade is in its own cardboard to protect the shade. This one was fully assembled and just banging around in the box which resulted in dents in the lamp shade.,1,False
6,81407905,Bought this lamp for my daughter’s room. Very sturdy and the color is exactly as shown. She loves the fact that there is a dimmer attached so she can choose how much light she needs. Definitely would recommend!,5,True
7,81407905,"This lamp is adorable but it doesn’t work properly. It made a loud buzzing noise on the higher settings and it flickered on the medium settings, so you could only have it on the super low, hardly any light setting without issues. Of the 3 I purchased only 1 didn’t do this so I just gave up and returned them all.",2,False
8,81407905,"My gosh it’s cute! Since I basically live in my home office now I’ve been making it my girly sanctuary. I’ve been looking for a fun lamp that also adds since different texture and shape. This was perfect. I wish it were bigger, but for $35 I can boost it with some books no problem.",5,True
9,81407905,"Adorable, playful, and modern. A tad small. The switch is on the cord though, which is so annoying if you have your cords hidden. Also the switch box is pretty big so you have to have your furniture a bit out from the wall. For the price point, these are great. They could have been even better.",4,True
10,81407905,"I bought one of these in-store to use in my entryway - with the dimmer on low, it makes a great night light! But I love it so much, I ordered a second and moved the pair to my living room. They are now on my console table and the dimmable light is perfect for watching TV at night. I know this is a kids' lamp, but it's super chic in white - looks like a higher end retailer!",5,
11,81407905,The light flickers when I turn it on. Super bummed. I’ll be returning it & continue my search for a nursery lamp.,1,False
12,81407905,Perfect for our nursery,5,True
13,81407905,The light was flickering.. kinda like shaking. It was odd and definitely had to turn it off immediately. I’ll be returning it.,1,False
14,81407905,The lamp shade is very thick. I wasn’t expecting such nice quality. My little one loves this lamp and so do I!,5,True

16,81407905,"I (an adult) got this for my nightstand and it's super cute. The color is nice, it's stable, gives a nice light. Nice simple little lamp.",5,
17,81407905,This lamp is so great! It’s so pretty. Had options for a different type of shade if you’d like to change it out (prong type setting inside.) The shade it comes with is great and the color is so pretty. I was totally unaware it has a dimming wheel so that was a huge plus! I have nothing negative to say about this lamp aside from it flickering occasionally from the color changing led bulb I have in it. But I figured out if you set the dimmer a little lower than the highest setting it will atop flickering.,5,True
18,81407905,"Purchased this lamp for our baby's nursery. The shade is sturdy and the warm mint base color is similar to online photos! I love the dimmable option--it works perfectly with LED dimmable bulb. I can definitely see our little one growing up with this lamp by her bedside. It is playful but not too ""childish""!",5,
19,81407905,"A great versatile lamp. It puts out just enough light. You can use it in any room. Very stylish and the white color can work in any decor. Small, but not too tiny. Easy on and off switch. The shade is a great shape. This is not your basic white lamp. All in all, a great lamp.",5,True

22,81407905,"This lamp is beautiful, I ordered it online so I wasn't sure how it would look and I think it looks much better in person! I wasn't sure about the color since it said sour cream but to me it looks white which is perfect because thats what I wanted. great addition to our guest bedroom.",5,True

2,79503441,"I fell in love with this lamp at the store, but it was cracked, so I ordered it on line! I bought the one with the lightbulb. Description states it has a 3-way setting, but a 3-way bulb does not work!!! I’M SOOOOOOOOOOOO DISAPPOINTED!!!",4,
3,79503441,"I was eyeing a Pottery Barn lamp for each side of my bed, but wasn’t loving the $350 per lamp price tag. These have a similar, vintagey pottery look for a fraction of the price. I would recommend purchasing these in store if you can, because they each look a little different. Some are more white, others more speckled, some the speckles are more dark grey vs blueish grey, and vice versa. I love picking up decor items that have a vintage look and feel to them, and its so hard to find pieces like that at an affordable price. Glad I found these!",5,True
4,79503441,Cute textured lamp that’s mostly white but with some gray/blue flecks that make it perfect for our son’s nursery! Paired it with a Montreal Project 62 large lampshade although I got the small lamp - love this look!,5,True

7,79503441,Stunning lamp. Look like something from RH or Pottery Barn. The concrete look is beautiful.,5,True
8,79503441,This lamp is the texture of a terra cotta pot and feels like a high end lamp. I painted mine and it took to the paint very well. Great price too! I’m happy with my purchase.,5,True
9,79503441,The first picture where it looks white is not representative. The second picture that shows it as more of a dingy gray with dark speckles is the true color. I ordered two and one arrived completely smashed inside the box. I got a refund for that but will be taking the non broken one to the store to return. It doesn’t look good in person.,2,False
10,79503441,Beautiful design and good quality.,5,True
11,79503441,This is a great lamp base that looks way more expensive than it is. It seems that most ceramic lamp bases this size cost way more. This one is a steal. I paired them with two large shades from Target. In my apartment they don’t look too small or too large. Overall I am very happy with them.,5,
12,79503441,Beautiful heavy lamp that looks high end,5,True

18,79503441,Arrived completely smashed upon arrival. Such a shame. Target really needs to learn how to package fragile items better,1,False
19,79503441,loved it.. looks much expensive than what it really is.. has texture and feel of clay pot.. very beautiful,5,
20,79503441,Gorgeous lamp! It favors a PB lamp that is priced almost $300!! Overall very happy witty this purchase!,5,True

3,53210577,"Perfect light, easy on off switch that my elderly mother can turn without issue.",5,
4,53210577,Bought 2-3 years ago. Finally unboxed it. Dead in the water. Non replaceable LED bulb--total waste of money and materials.,1,False
5,53210577,Cheap and great for studying!,5,
6,53210577,It’s bright. The lamp wouldn’t bend and hold position like I wanted. I was able to find a position that did stay and haven’t touched it since. It’s been good so far for the price. If you want a cheap lamp this will do the trick for you.,3,True
7,53210577,"I have had two of these lamps now for about two years. I didn't expect the clips or bending to hold up, but it has. I've moved, taken on a plane, and more with these. Perfect for nice lighting in zoom calls and for day to day. Definitely recommend and I'm still amazed by the quality!",5,True
8,53210577,good lamp for the price. I bought two for each side of the bed. one side solidly works and the other only work for a few months but light is no longer working. its LED so no light bulb to change buying another on...you get what you pay for.,5,
9,53210577,This reading lamp is great! It throws allot of light that can cover a large area. It has a very strong clip. My daughter uses it for a reading lamp during the dark winter months.,5,True
10,53210577,Nice & bright. Clips on my desk perfectly. Great price too!!,5,True
11,53210577,"The arm of the lamp is so weak and limp. When you try to adjust it, The head of the light falls right back down. It’s not worth any amount of money if it doesn’t work as advertised",1,False
12,53210577,"My kids use these lamps in a shared bedroom for night time reading in their bunks. The lights are a little bright so they just aim them at the walls to dim them a bit. I love that they don’t get hot, making them safe and easy for young kids to operate.",5,True
13,53210577,For the price I think it’ll do! The only flaw is that it doesn’t have settings for how bright the light can be. I just hope the LED bulbs last because you cannot replace!,5,True
14,53210577,Cheap and it clips where I need it.,4,
15,53210577,Lamp died almost immediately. There’s no way to fix it since the cover is attached you can’t get to the lightbulb.,1,False

22,53210577,"Strong clamp, good light intensity, no heat really to speak-of.",5,
23,53210577,I needed a clip on lamp and this one works great. I am hoping the built in LED lights last a long time.,5,
24,53210577,Bright little light. It doesn’t appear that the bulb will be replaceable but it will probably last a few years. At the price this little lamp gives a lot of light - great for task or reading and can clamp where you need it. The cord is long enough. The only thing I wish is the clamp would be a little wider but for the price it’s a great value.,4,True
25,53210577,Broke the first day.,1,False
26,53210577,Compact. Enough light for a desk.,5,True
27,53210577,"Clip not very strong. Gooseneck would not stay upright where I needed it. After (literally) 10 min the light flickered and died. Never came back on. Returned it immediately. I guess I should have realized it would not be good quality for the price, but was taken in by all the good reviews.",1,
28,53210577,"after only 10 minutes. The clip is not strong at all and kept sliding around on back of my chair. I had wanted a clip light to put on a chair that would increase light for hand sewing. In addition to a poor clip, the metal part did not hold up the light if I tried to adjust it. It sank instead. Really poor quality all around. Astonished that it has such good reviews (which is why I stupidly bought it).",1,
29,53210577,got this to attach to my bed to read at night and it’s perfect. it’s bright but not blinding. the neck is strong enough so the light isn’t dropping down onto my head at night.,4,True

36,53210577,Provides great light source especially above my computer.,5,

50,53210577,Best price and works great!  More than what I was looking for.,5,
51,53210577,"It’s decent quality, works for what I need it for. The only problem is that there’s no brightness change. It’s just—always insanely bright. This doesn’t affect me that much, but for most people who would want it for a normal desk or reading lamp won’t like it as much.",4,True
52,53210577,Very bright . We put it under the top bunk in my son’s bed room. Creates a great reading nook.,5,True
53,53210577,"This lamp was almost a good idea but the bulb is awful. The light is comparable to an outside porch light so it was way to blinding for my purposes of trying to read in the dark. I much prefer having a light in or a book light compared to this light. It really is a horrible spot light glaring lamp that I wanted to like but couldn't use. The clip feature is nice for some surfaces but again, there light is so ridiculous bright and irritating to the eyes that it doesn't matter. I returned this.",1,False

55,53210577,"i bought 2 of these for my sons' distance learning desks and, while i don't think they'll last very long, they'll work for the short term. the knobs are really cheap and i wish the neck were a bit longer so it could be angled down more but neither are anything i didn't expect. on the plus side, the gray color is a really nice shade and the clip is more generous that i expected. overall, i'm satisfied with this $7 lamp!",3,
56,53210577,Not sure about this light. Thought it had a regular light bulb. Hope it last for awhile since the bulb can't be replaced.  Did not say what kind of bulb it had,3,
57,53210577,"I bought one of these lamps to use as a supplemental “grow” light for my string of bananas plant that doesn’t get a whole lot of natural sunlight. Works great for me. Love that it clips on my hook, is adjustable & sturdy. Lamp stays in place where I put it. I’ll be buying more.",5,
58,53210577,"Just bought two of these. At this price, it's an easy decision for a reading light.

However... the gooseneck is too weak to hold the weight of the light! And so it doesn't stay in place. Or to be more correct, you have to find ""the right spot"" to get it to stay. But, in many positions it just hangs limply.

Another thing to be aware of, but I don't consider this a negative at this price point... the light is bright, and only has on/off... there's no dimming, or intermediate brightness settings. Perfectly understandable for this price point, but I hadn't considered it until I noticed so thought someone here might find this a helpful reminder.",1,
59,53210577,Exactly what I wanted,5,
60,53210577,For the money this is a great find. The brightness is not as bright as I needed and there is not adjusting but for the price this item is great.,4,

When I came on here to see how I could replace them, the manufacturer states that they can't be replaced and claims that they will last 11 years. This wasn't just a one-off for me; I bought two of them and they both died around the same time. At the $6 price point, it is a little more understandable, but just super annoying that I have to throw them both out and find new lighting now by my bed.",2,False
64,53210577,perfect for my needs,5,True

72,53210577,"This was a great little light while it lasted, but now that it's burned out, there's no way to replace the bulb. The whole light will have to be thrown away, which seems extremely wasteful. 

According to the Q&A section of this page (I was looking to see if there was any way to replace the part instead of the whole lamp), ""LED lights last around 50,000 hours. If used 12 hours a day, a 50,000 bulb will last more than 11 years. When the bulb burns out, it’s time to get a new one."" However, my lamp has certainly not lasted for 50,000 hours. I've had it for about 6 years (which isn't bad for such a cheap little guy!) but I only use it for about an hour a day -- it's my closet light. 

So: not bad value, but not performing as promised, either, and now I will have guilt over trashing the whole thing. Hopefully I can get a recycling center to take it.",4,
73,53210577,Got the citrus one with the white cord. Light switch is easy to turn with the large knob. Lamp can be clipped onto surfaces 1 inch in width. The fixed light bulb is bright and comes with a cover. The only con is that the light bulb can't be changed. Wish it was designed for long term use.,4,
74,53210577,"I suppose I didn't do my part by fully reading the specs for this little lamp, so the joke's on me. I bought 4 of these to use as supplemental light for a few houseplants that don't have access to natural night. I bought grow bulbs separately, thinking I'd just switch out the existing bulbs. Nope. This lamp's design has an ""integrated"" bulb, which just means, when it burns out, you have to throw the whole thing away.  Bad idea - just more eventual garbage for the landfills. Once again, you get what you pay for.",1,False
75,53210577,"This lamp is bright and inexpensive but the clip doesn't open wide enough to fit on anything wider than a bookshelf.  We got it to clip onto the headboard but the clip is open as wide as it will open so I don't think the clip part will hold up.  If it lasts a year, I'd feel lucky.  For a $6 lamp, it's still not a bad deal",3,
76,53210577,"This little lamp is great for small spaces. I have a little nightstand and wanted to clear as much as space on it as possible. I clipped the lamp to the shelf above the nightstand. It is super bright and does a great job pointing the light downward. However, when hung like this (downward), the neck does have a little trouble staying up; that is, the light tends to bend down. But for the price, you can't beat it!",4,True
77,53210577,"I love this little lamp so much! This is a replacement for a metal one I had that finally blew out on me....literally....the light bulb blew up. After picking up the shards, we got the threaded part out of the lamp and put in a new bulb...not long after it quit. It served its purpose, but this one is so much better! The light on it is great, it is lighter than the metal one, and the pièce de résistance---it doesn't get hot! Woohoo! This lamp is attached to the top of my easel to give me great light for painting at night. Thanks Target for having it available for pickup the very day I needed it! ------And the price is great too!------------The ""bigger"" picture (one where you can see the paint brushes pretty clearly) is without the room lights on, and the other two pics are with the room lights on.",5,True

83,53210577,"I bought this lamp to use with my puzzle table. I don't have much light so I figured having a lamp like this would help. Well, it doesn't. The light bends, but it doesn't stay that way so I get blinded and I get glares on my puzzle. I will be purchasing something else.",2,False
84,53210577,Perfect for my work desk,5,True

I'm not sure if it has to do with the light not being diffused, but looking at it is painful.

However, the lamps are very lightweight and the cats can knock them over FAR too easily, just by brushing by them with their tail.

I checked another store that was an hour drive and they had a few so I had the target worker look at them to see if they were in good quality he said he found one, so I had him pull it for me.

The cord is long, but it's also clear so the excess doesn't stick out. The lampshade is truly white, so with the right bulbs, it doesn't have a yellow tone that clashes with the base.

59,52404221,"This lamp is seriously the PERFECT size! I have a pretty short and small nightstand I tried a small lamp base with a small shade and it ended up being too short (about 18in in height) so that when I stood up the bright light was right in my eyes. So I tried a large lamp base and large shade but that was wayyy too big (about 35in in height) on my nightstand took up too much space and looked kinda ridiculous. So I saw this lamp and took the chance of trying it it’s the perfect height at 22in I looked at other places and it’s pretty rare to find a lamp at an in between height like this one. It’s also pretty slim only 7in in depth and that’s the shade, the base of it is even slimmer so doesn’t take up much space which I love! Also the shade is white which is perfect for color changing light bulbs doesn’t dull the color at all. Super modern looking and I think it’s priced very fairly definitely worth it!!",5,True

They are a bit too light (less than 3 lbs each) which worried me as they are going to be next to the bed and easily knocked over.  They also arrived with damaged shades.

66,52404221,I am honestly annoyed. This lamp is very pretty but when I came to pick up my order the shade cover of the lamp was dirty. To add to that the shade cover doesn't screw on tightly so it bounces slightly rocks back and forth. I would not recommend.,3,

The package arrived in one large box and when I opened the box,  the lamps were in two separate boxes. Packed very well.  To my surprise, the lamps were completely put together.  The shade and all. The energy efficient light bulb was already screwed in as well.  I didn't remove the lamps until today, the 20th. I chose this set because I liked the style.  Although the lamps aren't heavy in weight, I like them. The only issue I had was the color of the base.  It is lighter than I expected. I wanted a darker wood. I am going to keep and stain it a darker color.",4,
74,52404221,"We like these lamps a lot. They look very nice on our bedroom end tables. They appear to be well-made.

However, there is one problem. The shades are supposed to be attached to the lamps with a ""slip Uno fitter,"" according to a Target.com representative who answered one of the questions on the web page. And the second picture of the lamp on the left side of the page shows what apparently is the fitter screwed down on the outside of the light bulb socket. However, neither of the lamps that we ordered came with that kind of socket, not did they have the fitter. Instead, the sockets had the traditional ""harp"" structure. The catch is that the shades do NOT have the harp structure. They are designed for the fitter, to simply sit on the plastic ledge that the fitter screws down onto to secure the shade. When we talked to a Target.com representative about this today, he suggested we return the lamps to the store and order replacements. However, we have no confidence that the replacement lamps and shades would be any different from the ones we have. 

Since the shades fit well onto the socket casing, and don't really move even without the fitter, we will probably keep these lamps and shades. Just be forewarned that the way the shade is designed to be attached to the lamp may not match the way the lamp is designed to accept a shade!",4,

84,52404221,"I bought 2 of these lamps to go on the nightstands of my new bedroom suite, which is black with brass bar drawer pulls.  Perfection and so affordable!",5,True
85,52404221,They look great and more expensive than they are!,5,True
86,52404221,I bought 2 for my bed side tables. The size and height are just what I wanted. Love that the switch is 3 way to adjust for ambience or reading. Deducted a star only because I haven't figured out how to secure the shade firmly.,4,True
87,52404221,"One of the two lamps is not sturdy, it leans and there is no way to tighten it.  They look nice and will work for now but it's not great.",3,
88,52404221,"These lamps are great! I bought 2 and both work well, are made well, and are priced reasonably. The only thing is that the marble can look different on each lamp, so be sure to pay attention if you are buying more than one.",5,True

95,52404221,"Great addition to my newly redecorated living room. Sleek and modern, looks more expensive than it is. Appreciate the option to buy without bulb as I use only incandescent ones. Was concerned about the packaging as I've bought a different lamp from Target.com two different times and they both arrived with damaged shades that were inadequately packaged. But this one was very carefully packaged.",5,True
96,52404221,"Saw this initially at the store but both pieces at the store looked battered and damaged. Ordered online. Think that they simply went to the closest retail location and grabbed one of the damaged ones off the shelf and stuck it in a box, bc it looked to be just as badly scuffed and damaged as the ones I purposefully opted not to purchase at the store. Am imediately returning it, and will find a similar product from another retailer. I ordered online in order to receive a new item in good condition, not the beaten up and broken item I had already opted not to buy at the store. 

Also, the title of this listing says ""Lamp Only"" but the descriptions says ""Lamp and shade included"". It does NOT include the shade.",2,False
97,52404221,"Ordered 2 of these online and they both came badly damaged.  I attempted to exchange in store but the available lamps were also in bad shape (scuffed and marked), and had to go for a refund instead.
I would not recommend ordering online, go into the store and pick them out yourself.",1,False
